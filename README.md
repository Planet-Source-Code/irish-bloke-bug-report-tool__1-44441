### Description

Its avery basic program that you include with a program your writing to allow users to easily report bugs,errors,problems or send suggestion.

You can easily customize it, and with a a bit of work you could send the programs errors in the email.

This program is for reporting errors/commenst/etc by email via this program

Any comments or improvments you make please email me a copy.

I hope to use this with my new Mp3 program @ www.surf.to/mrdjmusicstudio
